This repo houses all of the custom `javascript` that I use when managing Google Tag Manager.

Note: This is code that I've collected over time as a marketing data analyst. The majority of the credit for this `javascript` goes to [Simo Avha](https://www.simoahava.com/). All of this would not be possible without the amazin work that he does and is freely shared on his website at [https://www.simoahava.com/](https://www.simoahava.com/). I do not claim owner or authorship of this code unless specifically noted.
